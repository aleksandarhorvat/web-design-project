        <h1>Music Career</h1>

        <h2>Formation of the Arctic Monkeys (2002—2004)</h2>
        <p>Turner's parents bought him a guitar for Christmas in 2001. In a 2013 interview, Turner stated that it was during this period that he first began writing songs, using a bass guitar and a large selection of microphones. In mid-2002, Turner, Cook, Nicholson and Helders decided to form a band. The name Arctic Monkeys was coined by Cook. Turner originally did not want to be a singer; a number of students, including Glyn Jones, tried out before Turner became the lead singer. All four were originally beginners on their instruments; they practiced in Turner and Helderson's garage and later in a disused warehouse in Watt. At first, the band's original songs used nonsense words, but Turner gradually began to share his lyrics with his bandmates. They practiced for a year before their first performance. Their first gig was on Friday 13 June 2003 at a local pub called "Grapes". Their repertoire consisted of eight songs, five of which were original.</p>

        <h2>First albums and commercial success (2005-2007)</h2>
        <p>In May 2005, they released their first EP, Five Minutes With Arctic Monkeys. The band signed a contract with Domino Records in 2005. Their first album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, was released in January 2006 and became the fastest-selling debut album in British music history. The album is often regarded as a concept album, relating to UK nightlife. Their second album, Favorite Worst Nightmare, was released in April 2007. They recorded a concert in Manchester, where Richard Holley was a guest.</p>
