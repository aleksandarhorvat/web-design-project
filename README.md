# web-design-project
Project in Web design that I did for my faculty
<br><br>This project is made very simple because it is made with the intention of showing the basic concepts of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
<br><br>The theme of the project was arbitrary, and I decided on Alex Turner, one of my favorite artists.
<br><br>This repository is designed as a template for the basic structure of the website, and the topic of the website can be changed to suit your needs, and the functionality itself can be improved a lot since, as I said, this project is intended to be the basis.
